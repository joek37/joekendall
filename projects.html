This survey experiment focuses on how individuals react to information about ancestral involvement in the slave trade, demonstrating how the invocation of familial identity when engaging with ‘uncomfortable’ histories can help to reduce backlash and inter-group prejudice.</p>

In this survey experiment I test the implications of rhetorical appeals to ‘worse’ cases used by members of perpetrator groups to legitimise their group’s history. I find that such defensive strategies not only enable participants to avoid confronting ‘uncomfortable’ histories but actively increase prejudice towards victimized outgroups.</p>
